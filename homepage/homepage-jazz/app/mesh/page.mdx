# Jazz Global Mesh

<Slogan>Serverless sync & storage for Jazz apps.</Slogan>

Real-time sync and storage infrastructure that scales up to millions of users.<br/>
Pricing that scales down to zero.

## The first Collaboration Delivery Network

<Slogan small>Build demanding apps with distributed state, backed by a new kind of cloud.</Slogan>

<Grid>
<GridCard>
#### Optimal mesh routing.

Get ultra-low latency between any group of users with our decentralized mesh interconnect.
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Smart caching.

Give users instant load times, with their latest data state always cached close to them.
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Blob storage & media streaming.

Store files and media streams as idiomatic `CoValues` without S3.

## Pricing

### Free Tier
<span className="text-lg font-medium bg-emerald-200 dark:bg-emerald-800 px-2 py-1 rounded">Until we implement billing all usage of Global Mesh is free!</span>
<p className="text-sm">Later, any usage under $1/mo will be free.</p>

### Unlimited <ComingSoonBadge/>


<div className="lg:text-2xl border rounded-lg px-1 py-3 text-center">${pricePer1MtxSyncedOut} <small>per 1M TXs synced out</small> + ${pricePer1MtxStored}<small>/mo per 1M TXs stored</small></div>

<p><small>$6/mo minimum usage</small></p>

A TX (transaction) represents an **individual user action**, or **up to 100KB of binary data**.
</GridItem>

<GridItem className="col-start-1">
#### Transactions synced out:
<div className="text-sm">
- Transactions sent out from Global Mesh, each counted once for every device it is synced out to.
- Depending on cache behavior each transaction should only be synced out once per connection, ideally once per device requesting it.
</div>
</GridItem>
<GridItem>
#### Transactions stored:
<div className="text-sm">
- Transactions that are continuously persisted.
- Counted per second.
- Includes backups, hot storage and edge caches.
</div>
</GridItem>
</Grid>

**Examples:**

The number of transactions generated is highly app-specific and depends on user behaviour, but here are some examples:

<div className="text-sm">
- 4 users co-editing 10 pages of text, typing them out as individual character inserts:
  - 3,000 inserts/page &times; 10 pages = 30,000 transactions
  - 30,000 transactions stored = ${30000 * pricePerTxStored} / mo
  - 3 &times; 30,000 transactions synced out = ${3 * 30000 * pricePerTxSyncedOut} one-time
- 4 users collaborating on a canvas, moving shapes around at 10 FPS for 10s/min for 2h/day for a month
    - 4 users &times; 10 FPS &times; 10s/min &times; 60min/h * 2h/day &times; 30days = 1.44M transactions
    - 1.44M transactions stored = ${1440000 * pricePerTxStored} / mo = ${1440000 * pricePerTxStored / 4} / mo / user
    - 3 &times; 1.44M transactions synced out =  ${(3 * 1440000 * pricePerTxSyncedOut).toLocaleString("en-US", { maximumSignificantDigits: 3, })} one-time = ${(3 * 1440000 * pricePerTxSyncedOut / 4).toLocaleString("en-US", { maximumSignificantDigits: 3, })} one-time / user
- A livestreamer streaming video (1GB total) to 100 viewers (combined live & on-demand)
  - 1GB = 10,000 transactions (100KB each)
  - 10,000 transactions stored = ${10000 * pricePerTxStored} / mo (= ${10000 * 1000 * pricePerTxStored} per 1TB stored)
  - 100 &times; 10,000 transaction synced out = ${100 * 10000 * pricePerTxSyncedOut} one-time (= ${10000 * 1000 * pricePerTxSyncedOut} per 1TB egress)
</div>

## Custom Deployment Scenarios

<Slogan>You can rely on Global Mesh. But you don't have to.</Slogan>

<p>Because Jazz is open-source, you can optionally run your own sync nodes &mdash; in a variety of setups.</p>

<Grid>
<GridCard>
#### Global Mesh + Data Backup Node.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Connect your users to Global Mesh for all its benefits, but also run and connect your own data backup node (just in case.)</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Extra costs:
- Instance costs for the backup node.
- Moderate self-hosted storage costs.
- Every transaction is additionally synced to your backup node and counted as synced out.
</div>
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Global Mesh + DIY Mesh.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Connect your users to Global Mesh, or your own nodes as a lower-performance fallback. The two networks stay in constant sync.</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Extra costs:
- N × instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Typically moderate self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
- Every transaction is additionally synced to your DIY mesh and counted as synced out.
</div>
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Completely DIY Mesh.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Build your own network of sync and storage nodes.
Handle networking, security and backups yourself.</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Costs:
- N × instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Very high self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
