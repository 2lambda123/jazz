## Custom Deployment Scenarios

<Slogan>You can rely on Global Mesh. But you don't have to.</Slogan>

<p>Because Jazz is open-source, you can optionally run your own sync nodes &mdash; in a variety of setups.</p>

#### Global Mesh + Data Backup Node.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Connect your users to Global Mesh for all its benefits, but also run and connect your own data backup node (just in case.)</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Extra costs:
- Instance costs for the backup node.
- Moderate self-hosted storage costs.
- Every transaction is additionally synced to your backup node and counted as synced out.
</div>
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Global Mesh + DIY Mesh.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Connect your users to Global Mesh, or your own nodes as a lower-performance fallback. The two networks stay in constant sync.</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Extra costs:
- N × instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Typically moderate self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
- Every transaction is additionally synced to your DIY mesh and counted as synced out.
</div>
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Completely DIY Mesh.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Build your own network of sync and storage nodes.
Handle networking, security and backups yourself.</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Costs:
- N × instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Very high self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
