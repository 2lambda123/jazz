# Instant sync.

<Slogan>Go beyond request/response &mdash; ship modern apps with sync.</Slogan>

Jazz is an open-source toolkit for building apps with **sync** & **secure collaborative data.**

<h2 className="md:mt-24">Hard things are easy now.</h2>

Jazz replaces APIs, DBs and message queues with **a single new abstraction: CoJSON**.

And you get **built-in capabilities** that took best-in-class apps years to build:

## A new standard for secure collaborative data.

Jazz is built around **CoJSON,** a new abstraction that implements **multi-device co-editing,** **user identities,** **permissions,**  **sync** and **persistence** in a standardized way.

CoJSON makes collaboration and secure access control feel like **inherent properties of your data**.

### Collaborative Values

<Slogan small>Your new building blocks.</Slogan>

Collaborative Values (CoValues) **can be edited as if they were simple local data,** but they're **automatically encrypted, signed** and **synced** between participants.

CoValues also **retain their full edit history,** including author metadata and potential editing conflicts. This makes it **super simple to build collaborative and social features.**

    - Immutable JSON & IDs of other CoValues
